The purpose of this website is to display the results of tweets that were run through a machine learning BERT model that labeled each tweet as true or false. The tweets are seperated by if they are coming from verified accounts or not. 
Aiming to have a web application up soon that utilizes the machine learning model as the backend, with the frontend consisting of user text input that they want to run through the model.
The load_pretrained model contains the BERT ML model that was used for this analysis.
